Melee DPS Scaling Model

Melee Skill<=4 : 40%(?) less damage, 20% Melee Cooldown Nerf
4<Melee Skill>8 : Scales to Vanilla DPS
Melee Skill = 8 : Vanilla
8<Melee Skill>=16 : Damages scales to 150% of the base, 25% Melee Cooldown buff
Melee Skill = 16+ : Damage and Melee Cooldown hardcaps at 200% and 50% respectively at level 20.
If it's possible to go beyond 20 melee skill, then the reductions to melee cooldown should be alot less the the gains in damage.
Any scaling past 20 should be logarithimic. The whole system can be logarithmic if that's easier to code.

(There will eventually be a settings page where players can adjust Damage and Melee Cooldown Scaling)

Manipulation: For every 50% additional Manipulation past 100%, the pawn gains a 10% Melee DPS buff.

Reach - Vanilla Melee combat at range

- Reach is a ranged stat that operates indepently of the vanilla ranged systems.

When a pawn attempts to strike a target within their Reach, the rolls the attackers melee hit chance
againist their target's melee block/dodge chance. If the attack succeeds, the attacker inflicts damage on their target.

- Reach = 0-1 : Vanilla

- Reach is a combat stat that should appear in a weapon's melee stats and in a pawn's combat stat
( All pawns should have a reach of 1. 1 is the minimum achievable reach)

[There will eventual be a setttings page where players can manually set a weapon's reach]

Enhanced Attacks

Much like the (Breach) verb allows the Breach Ax to deal extra damage to structures, Enhance Attacks add special action to melee hits

(Pierce) : On a successful hit, this attack will deal damage to anyone behind the target
(Cleave) : On a successful hit, this attack will deal damage to anyone besides the target
(Lunge) : This attack has 2 additional Reach
(Shred) : This attack does additional damage to the target's apparel
(Smash) : On a successful hit, this attack will knock back the target one space. If movement is impossible, stun instead.
(Stun)  : On a successful hit, this attack can(by chance?) momentarily stun a target.

[Planned: Players will be able to assign Enhanced Attacks to melee weapons in the settings page.]
