# Weapons-of-War-Melee-Combat-Expansion
Weapons of War is a mod that aims to expand melee combat in Rimworld. By the addition of a unified stat to scale melee effectiveness and the implementation of an intuitive and dynamic weapon class system, your melee weapons will become more then just PNGs with stats.

In Weapons of War, weapons are assigned a **Type** and a **Class**.
Depending on the weapon's classification, the item will gain access to **Opportunity Attacks**(OA), special actions that pawns can use in combat. The OAs availble to a weapon will define its use on the battlefield, giving a purpose of their own outside of being a DPS stick.

As a pawn gains higher levels of Melee Skill, they gain **Melee Expertise**, a value which determines how effectively a pawn use a weapon.
